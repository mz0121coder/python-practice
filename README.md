# python-practice

During the christmas/new year break I wanted to try a new challenge, so I started the Scientific Computing with Python certification on FreeCodeCamp.

The exercises folder contains programs that can be run locally. For example, `cd exercises` and `python expense_tracker.py` will run the expense tracker in the terminal.
